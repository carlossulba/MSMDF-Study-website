            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                Welcome, and thank you for considering participating in our study! Your involvement is crucial in helping us explore the privacy implications of motion sensors in mobile devices.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                Motion sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, play an important role in how mobile devices interact with the world. However, these sensors can also be used to track and identify devices through a technique known as Motion Sensor-based Mobile Device Fingerprinting (MSMDF). This experiment aims to evaluate and develop countermeasures to protect users against this technique.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                During this study, we will collect data from your deviceâ€™s motion sensors. Your participation will help us better understand how to safeguard user privacy in mobile environments.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                The study involves 10 data collection sessions, each lasting approximately 2 minutes. In each session, you will follow a series of 5 steps designed to simulate real-world usage. Your careful and consistent participation will be invaluable in ensuring the reliability of the data we collect.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                In "Is my first time", you will find the detailed steps you need to follow during each data collection session. Please take your time to understand the process.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                We take your privacy seriously. All data collected in this study will be anonymized and used exclusively for the purposes of this experiment. Only data from the motion sensors will be collected, and no personal identifiers will be recorded.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-justify">
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> No biometric human fingerprints will be recorded. The term "sensor fingerprint" refers to the unique patterns in the data produced by a specific sensor.
